#Roman Numerals TDD kata project.

The aim is to follow the TDD lifecycle using ruby-plsql and implement a decimal to roman numerals conversion function.
The function should work properly for numbers up to 3000.

To visualize the flow of TDD the commit frequency is to be as follows:

1. Write a test that fails, run it, commit

2. Write as little code as to cover the test, run tests, make sure they all pass, commit

3. Refactor code and tests making sure they still pass, so no business rule is changed

4. Continue with next case

That was my second PLSQL programming kata.
First one was with FizzBuzz (thanks to Krzysztof Jelski from Pragmatists)
